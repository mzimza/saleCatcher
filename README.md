# saleCatcher
**SaleCatcher** is an iOS app written in *Swift3*, which allows you to keep track of products, which you want to buy, but only if they are on sale.
Once the observed products is on sale, a notification is created.

######There are supposed to be two views:
1. with all products, from which you can select products which you want to observe
2. with the observed products

*For now it is only a still under development application, which displays only products from www.rossmann.pl.*

######Things that still need to be done:
- [x] Write a crawler to gather data from www.rossmann.pl
- [x] Create two views with basic functionality
- [x] Save downloaded data to memory
- [ ] Enable background fetch
- [ ] Create Search field
- [ ] Work on the design of UI
